# Typescript Node Boilerplate

This repoitory is a simple boilerplate for typescript. It compiles the typescript code from `/src` to `/dist` and runs it inside node.

There are two npm scripts to do so:

1. `npm run tsc` -> compiles from src to dist
2. `npm run watch` -> watches ./dist and runs the file index.ts

## Prerequisites

Only [**Node** ](https://nodejs.org/) is needed on the system.

## Get Started

1. Clone the repository

```bash
git clone https://github.com/orporeater/typescript-node-boilerplate.git
```

2. Navigate into the repository
3. Install node modules

```bash
npm install
```

4. Start programming in [src/index.ts](src\index.ts)
